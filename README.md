 # An explanation of the purpose of each file in your repository
 - Movie_trivia_game.py contains our code/program, including all our methods, functions, classes, objects, etc.
 - Question_code_for_project.py contains two dictionaries that are imported to our movie_trivia_game.py file. These two dictionaries consist of movie questions and movie answers.
 # Clear instructions on how to run your program from the command line
 - In order to run our program, all you have to do is type python3 or python (windows) along with the file name, movie_trivia_game.py. In doing so, the game will begin and the user will be prompted to enter their names and choose a difficulty level.
   Ex: python3 Movie_Trivia_Game.py
 # Clear instructions on how to use your program and/or interpret the output of the program, as applicable
 - Follow each prompt given, such as player 1’s name, player 2’s name, and level of difficulty. Each player will then be called and prompted to answer a given movie question. Once answered, our program will verify if the answer is correct or incorrect and display that to the player. After five rounds for each player, a score will be given showing which player got a higher score. Players will then be asked if they would like to play again.
